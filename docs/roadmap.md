# Project Roadmap

## Current State
- ✅ Project initialized with basic documentation
- ✅ README.md created with simple project description
- ✅ Project outline defined in `docs/outline.md` with detailed requirements
- ✅ CLAUDE.md created with development guidance in `.claude/` folder
- ✅ Fully functional Streamlit app with restaurant bill splitting
- ✅ `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` files created
- ✅ Python virtual environment created (`venv/`)
- ✅ Pre-configured restaurant system with JSON data
- ✅ Course-based pricing system for restaurants like Frank's Kro
- ✅ Duplicate item support for drinks and other categories
- ✅ Friend-centric assignment UI with quantity tracking

## Current Focus
**Ready for Step 4: Implement Bill Calculation Logic**
- The core functionality is complete, but needs formal calculation and results display
- Export functionality (Step 5) and reset functionality (Step 6) remain

## Pending Issues
- No critical issues blocking development
- Code is functional and ready for next development phase
