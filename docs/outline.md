## 5. Technical Architecture

*   **Language:** Python 3.9+
*   **Framework:** Streamlit. This is the required framework to ensure the entire application can be built within a single Python script without separate frontend code.
*   **Primary Libraries:**
    *   `streamlit`: For the web framework and all UI components.
    *   `pandas`: To structure the data for clean and easy export to XLSX.
    *   `openpyxl`: The engine for Pandas to write `.xlsx` files.
    *   `json`: For loading pre-configured restaurant data.
*   **State Management:**
    *   All application state managed using Streamlit's `st.session_state` object with `current_party_id` determining active party.
    *   Party data persisted in browser localStorage with automatic saving on state changes.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Party Object:** Each party stored in localStorage with structure:
        ```python
        {
            "id": str,              # Unique party identifier (UUID)
            "name": str,            # User-defined party name
            "restaurant_name": str, # Selected restaurant
            "selected_restaurant": str, # Restaurant selection key
            "created": str,         # ISO datetime string
            "last_updated": str,    # ISO datetime string  
            "friends": list[str],   # List of friend names
            "items": list[dict],    # Menu items (same structure as before)
            "total_cost": float     # Calculated total for quick display
        }
        ```
    *   **Items List:** Within each party, items follow existing structure:
        ```python
        {
            "name": str,
            "category": str,  # Starter, Main, Dessert, Drink, Other
            "cost": float,
            "ordered_by": list[str], # Friend names (duplicates for quantities)
            "is_course_item": bool   # For course-based pricing
        }
        ```
    *   **localStorage Structure:**
        ```javascript
        {
            "restaurant_bill_splitter_parties": {
                "party_uuid_1": {...party_data...},
                "party_uuid_2": {...party_data...}
            },
            "restaurant_bill_splitter_current_party": "party_uuid_1"
        }
        ```
*   **File Structure:**
    *   `app.py`: The single Python file containing all application logic and UI definitions (982 lines).
    *   `restaurants.json`: Pre-configured restaurant menus with course pricing data.
    *   `requirements.txt`: A file listing all library dependencies.
    *   `dev-requirements.txt`: Development dependencies.
    *   `docs/outline.md`: Comprehensive project documentation.
    *   `docs/roadmap.md`: Implementation progress tracking.
    *   `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: Development guidance for Claude Code.
