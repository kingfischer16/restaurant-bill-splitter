## 3. Current Functional Capabilities

**âœ… IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:**

* **F1: Party Management:** âœ… Create, name, and save multiple dining parties with UUID identifiers. Each party maintains independent session data.
* **F1B: Party Persistence:** âœ… All party data persists in browser localStorage across sessions, refreshes, and browser closures.
* **F1C: Party Loading:** âœ… Load existing parties from localStorage with complete state restoration.
* **F2: Restaurant Selection:** âœ… Choose from pre-configured restaurants (Frank's Kro, The Burger Joint, Sakura Sushi) or create custom restaurants.
* **F2B: Course-Based Pricing:** âœ… Full support for restaurants with course pricing models (Frank's Kro with course fees).
* **F2C: Custom Restaurant Creation:** âœ… Complete menu builder for custom restaurants with category classification.
* **F3: Add Menu Items:** âœ… Form to input item name, category, and cost. Items classified by category (Starter, Main, Dessert, Drink, Other).
* **F4: Add Friends:** âœ… Input field with validation, duplicate prevention, and real-time total display.
* **F5: Friend-Centric Assignment:** âœ… Dropdown-based item selection per friend with quantity controls.
* **F5B: Category-Based Quantities:** âœ… Drink and Other items allow multiple quantities; Starter/Main/Dessert are unique per person.
* **F5C: Real-Time Totals:** âœ… Live calculation and display of totals per friend in Danish Krone (DKK).
* **F6: Calculate Bill Split:** âœ… Each friend pays full cost for items they ordered (no cost sharing).
* **F7: Display Results:** âœ… Comprehensive bill calculation page with individual breakdowns and party totals.
* **F8: Mobile Optimization:** âœ… Responsive design without scroll boxes, mobile-friendly interface.
* **F9: Currency Localization:** âœ… Danish Krone (DKK) formatting throughout application ("75.00 kr" format).

**ðŸš€ ADVANTAGES OF REACT IMPLEMENTATION:**

* **Better User Experience:** No page refreshes, instant state updates, smooth interactions
* **Mobile Performance:** Optimized for mobile devices with responsive design
* **Deployment Flexibility:** Static files can be deployed anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
* **No Server Required:** Pure client-side application with localStorage persistence
* **Modern Development:** Hot reloading, component architecture, easier maintenance
* **Security:** No iframe constraints, direct localStorage access

## 5. Technical Architecture

* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Framework:** React 18.2.0. React provides superior user experience, mobile performance, and deployment flexibility compared to server-based solutions.
* **Primary Libraries:**
  * `react`: Core React library for component-based UI
  * `react-dom`: React DOM rendering
  * `react-scripts`: Create React App build tools and development server
  * `web-vitals`: Performance monitoring (optional)
* **State Management:**
  * All application state managed using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
  * Party data persisted in browser localStorage with automatic saving
  * Real-time state synchronization across components
* **Data Structures:**
  * **Party Object:** Each party stored in localStorage with structure:
    ```javascript
    {
      "id": string,              // Unique party identifier (timestamp + random)
      "name": string,            // User-defined party name  
      "restaurant_name": string, // Selected restaurant name
      "selected_restaurant": string, // Restaurant selection key
      "custom_menu_items": array, // Custom menu items for custom restaurants
      "created": string,         // ISO datetime string
      "last_updated": string,    // ISO datetime string
      "friends": array,          // List of friend names
      "orders": object,          // Friend orders: {friendName: [items]}
      "total_cost": number       // Calculated total for quick display
    }
    ```
  * **Order Item Structure:**
    ```javascript
    {
      "id": string,           // Unique item identifier
      "name": string,         // Item name
      "cost": number,         // Item cost in DKK
      "quantity": number,     // Quantity ordered
      "category": string      // Starter, Main, Dessert, Drink, Other
    }
    ```
  * **localStorage Structure:**
    ```javascript
    {
      "restaurant_parties": [
        {...party_data_1...},
        {...party_data_2...}
      ]
    }
    ```
* **File Structure:**
  * `react-app/src/App.js`: Main React component containing all application logic (700+ lines)
  * `react-app/public/index.html`: HTML template with embedded responsive CSS
  * `react-app/public/restaurants.json`: Pre-configured restaurant menus with DKK pricing
  * `react-app/package.json`: Dependencies and build scripts
  * `docs/outline.md`: Comprehensive project documentation
  * `docs/roadmap.md`: Implementation progress tracking
